    "# Bank Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Customer churn is a major concern for banks because acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.  \n",
    "This project demonstrates how machine learning can predict customers likely to leave a bank, enabling proactive retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset contains demographic, financial, and account-related information for bank customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Features:**\n",
    "  - `credit_score`, `country`, `gender`, `age`, `tenure`, `balance`, `products_number`, `credit_card`, `active_member`, `estimated_salary`\n",
    "- **Target Variable:**\n",
    "  - `churn` (0 = Customer stayed, 1 = Customer left)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Data Overview:**\n",
    "- 10,000 records, 12 columns  \n",
    "- No missing values or duplicates  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Churn distribution shows class imbalance: 7,963 stayed vs 2,037 left.  \n",
    "- Customers aged 51–60 and those using fewer products are more likely to churn.  \n",
    "- Feature importance shows `age` and `products_number` as the strongest predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Numerical Features:** MinMaxScaler  \n",
    "- **Categorical Features:** OneHotEncoder (drop first)  \n",
    "- **Class Imbalance:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "The following models were trained using pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Key Notes |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|\n",
    "| Logistic Regression | Baseline model with class_weight balanced |\n",
    "| Random Forest | Slight improvement with SMOTE |\n",
    "| AdaBoost | Good recall for churned customers |\n",
    "| Gradient Boosting | Best overall performance; hyperparameter tuning applied |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameter Tuning:**  \n",
    "- Applied on Gradient Boosting Classifier using GridSearchCV  \n",
    "- Tuned parameters: `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "- Metrics used: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  \n",
    "- Focused on recall and ROC-AUC to identify churned customers accurately  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance (after tuning Gradient Boosting):**  \n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Precision | Recall | F1-score | ROC-AUC |\n",
    "|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|\n",
    "| Gradient Boosting (Tuned) | 0.60 | 0.70 | 0.64 | 0.873 |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Insights\n",
    "- Age is the most significant predictor of churn.  \n",
    "- Customers with fewer products have a higher likelihood of leaving.  \n",
    "- Targeting retention strategies to at-risk segments can reduce churn and improve lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Recommendations\n",
    "- Focus on customers aged 51–60 and those using fewer banking products.  \n",
    "- Offer personalized services and cross-selling opportunities.  \n",
    "- Use predictive churn models for early intervention.\n",
